## Tool Description 

Social media has become the leading platform where consumers share information regarding their thoughts, preferences, and personal beliefs. While most of this data is accessible to everyone, companies still face the struggle of integrating these data points into a business context that can help them in gaining a comprehensive consumer understanding that will assist in achieving a competitive edge. As a result, this paper investigated how social media can be used as a tool to help drive business decisions in the retail industry. An initial discovery phase on the existing literature and solutions revealed a research gap, especially within the trend analysis segment and the food \& beverage industry. An analysis of what tools and technologies should be applied to create such a solution followed. Empirical research from both industry experts and consumers allowed getting a better understanding of the current climate, and what is lacking. The combined findings then led to developing a proof of concept, in form of a dashboard, that can identify trending products and analyze their popularity. Ultimately, the findings indicate there is indeed a relationship between what people share online and real retail market movements. The dashboard presents a novel approach of identifying upcoming retail trends based on social media data. While the proof of concept serves as a good indicator of the possibilities this topic presents, the paper also discusses some of the key points that need to be addressed before it could become a solution that is ready for the market.
